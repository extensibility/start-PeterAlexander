# Lesson 5:  Explaining API Management
##  LESSON OBJECTIVES
  After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
    -   Explain the use of API management

## API Management

  In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

    -   What can I do with it?
    
    -   Components
    
    -   SAP API Management key features
    
    -   Typical use case
    
    -   Steps to provide an custom API

##  What can I do with it?
 
  You can enable enterprise collaboration and co-innovation that means:
 
##  What is SAP API Management?

    -   Publish, promote, and oversee APIs in a secure and scalable
        environment with the API Management capability. Empower developer
        communities to monetize data and digital assets in new channels,
        devices, and UIs.
    
    -   Common platform to define and publish APIs.
    
    -   Related APIs bundled and offered as a product
    
    -   Comprehensive consumption analytics capabilities.
    
    -   Monetization feature for all API providers.

###  Using an API Management layer will allow companies to:

    -   Create an Omni-channel experience for customers and employees
        (mobile, web, devices).
    
    -   Implement simplified Integration with various ecosystems (partners,
        suppliers, marketplaces etc.).
    
    -   Expose data with external ecosystems to generate new revenue streams
        (Data-as-a- Service).
 
## Components

  The API Management belongs to the Integration Suite on SAP Cloud
  Platform. It has two parts:

    -   API Portal
    
    -   Developer Portal

##  SAP API Management key features are:

    -   Configuration instead of coding
    
    -   Efficient API Publishing
    
    -   Broad analytics

## Further details:
 
###  Configuration instead of coding
 
  Managing APIs consists of applying standard features in the areas of
  security, traffic management and mediation. All these features are
  pre-defined within SAP API Management, and simply need to be adapted
  to your needs.This allows to centrally simplify and streamline the
  management of APIs, in order to increase agility and to enforce
  central governance easily.
 
###  Efficient API Publishing
 
  One of the most important aspects of API Management, is to simplify
  API consumption for the Application Developer. Hence API Management
  provides a self-service and integrated Developer Portal, featuring
  self-service capabilities, searching, documentation, testing and
  subscription capabilities.This allows to reduce the time and effort of
  onboarding Developers, allowing for better time-to-market and reduced
  costs.
 
###  Broad analytics
 
  API usage is not limited to internal consumption, hence monitoring and
  analytics are even more relevant than before. API Management provides
  central, technical and business-driven analytic capabilities.This
  allows to quickly solve issues for increased user
 
  satisfaction and to steer your API program for an optimal return on
  investment of your digitalization projects.
  
### How does it work ?- What do I do for it?
 
 ![How does it work ?- What do I do for it?](.//media/image37.jpeg)


  From a high-level perspective, SAP API Management is divided in three
  main areas: 
  
  1: designing APIs through the API Portal.
 
  3: Consume it with Internet Technologies.
 
  3: Providing APIs through the Developer Portal.
 
##  Typical use case

![Typical Use Case](.//media/image38.jpeg)

  API management in the middle between APIs delivery and APIs consumers.
 
##  Steps to provide an custom API
 
  Steps to provide an custom API:
 
  1: Create an API Provider artefact based on an API resource located
  elsewhere.
 
  ![First Step to Provide an Custom API](.//media/image39.jpeg)
 
  2: Create an API Proxy artefact based on the API Provider artefact.

![Second Step](.//media/image40.jpeg)

  3: Configure your API Proxy via policies
 
 ![Third Step](.//media/image41.jpeg)
 
  4: Create a product/application and sell it. Manage within the Developer
  Portal

##  LESSON SUMMARY
 
  You should now be able to:

    -   Explain the use of API management
