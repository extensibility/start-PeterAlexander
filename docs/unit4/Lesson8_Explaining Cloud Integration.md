# Lesson 8: Explaining Cloud Integration
##  LESSON OBJECTIVES
 
  After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

    -   Explain the use and the main components of the Cloud Integration

## Cloud Integration

###  In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

    -   What can I do with it?
    
    -   Sample of a out-of-the box scenario.
    
    -   How does it work ?- What do I do.
    
    -   What are the advantages.

##  What can I do with it?

    -   Support end-to-end process integration through the exchange of
        messages.
    
    -   SAP Cloud Platform Integration service helps you to connect cloud
        and on-premise applications with other SAP and non-SAP cloud and
        on-premise applications.
    
    -   This service has the capabilities to process messages in real-time
        scenarios spanning different companies, organizations, or
        departments within one organization.
    
    -   It runs as an SaaS App on the SAP cloud Platform - Integration as a
        Service.

  On this slide the concept and the idea of out of the box integration
  is summarized again. On the left are indicated many common NO SAP
  partners, all of whom have to exchange data with the various
  components of the Intelligent Suite.
 
###  The Features are:

    -   Implement diverse scenarios.
    
    -   Connect to multiple endpoints.
    
    -   Customize SAP integration scenarios.
    
    -   Develop custom adapters.
    
    -   Access public APIs.
    
    -   Set up secure and reliable communication.
    
    -   Implement various communication modes.
    
    -   Integrate with SAP Process Orchestration.

  That means in detail:
 
####  Implement diverse scenarios
 
  Integrate processes and data in application-to-application (A2A) and
  business-to- business (B2B) scenarios.
 
####  Connect to multiple endpoints
 
  Integrate various applications and data sources from SAP and non-SAP,
  on premise, as well as the cloud. SAP Cloud Platform Integration comes
  with a set of prebuilt adapters.
 
####  Customize SAP integration scenarios
 
  Benefit from prepackaged integration content to jump-start integration
  projects and to set up productive scenarios with only minimum effort.
  You can extend predefined integration flows according to your
  requirements.
 
####  Develop custom adapters
 
  Use the adapter SDK to build your own custom adapters for additional


####  Access public APIs
 
  Customize the access to SAP Cloud Platform Integration with our public
  OData APIs.
 
####  Set up secure and reliable communication
 
  Use our core integration and security capabilities for the safe and
  reliable processing of messages. Configure the way how messages are
  exchanged within an integration scenario so that the data involved is
  protected according to the newest security standards.
 
####  Implement various communication modes
 
  Orchestrate business processes and integrate data in synchronous as
  well as in asynchronous scenarios. SAP Cloud Platform Integration also
  supports reliable messaging processes based on asynchronous decoupling
  implemented by using queuing mechanisms.
 
####  Integrate with SAP Process Orchestration
 
  Use SAP Cloud Platform Integration and SAP's on-premise integration
  Platform, SAP Process Orchestration, seamlessly integrated.
 
##  Sample of a out-of-the box scenario

![Sample of an Predifined iFlow](.//media/image55.jpeg)

  The figure shows the Cloud Integration Cockpit - Discover view. A
  predefined process is selected. The individual tiles mean predefined
  functionality for processing the data.
 
##  How does it work ?- What do I do for it?
 
  The cockpit is the central point for managing all activities
  associated with your subaccount and for accessing key information
  about your applications.

  Explanations about the bubbles:

1.  Discover view

2.  Design view

3.  Operations view

4.  Tenant settings

###  Discover view
 
  Here you will find all available pre-defined Iflows that you can use
  directly.
 
 ![Discover View](.//media/image57.jpeg)
  Here you can explore and copy a lot of predefined iFlows.
 
###  Design view
 
  Create your own iFlow or use an preconfigured iFlow.

![Design View](.//media/image58.jpeg)

  You will see two own and one pre-configured Scenario. Here you can
  create your own iFlow, configure an preconfigured or extend an already
  existing iFlow.
 
###  Operations view
 
  Here you can :

    -   Monitor Message Processing
    
    -   Manage Integration Content
    
    -   Manage Security
    
    -   Manage Stores

  ![Operations View](.//media/image59.jpeg)
 
  In this view you can see the different usable functionalities. The
  implementation follows the DevOps approach.
 
###  Tenant settings view
 
  Here you have several options to configure your tenant.

![Tenant Settings View](.//media/image60.jpeg)

  Only administrative tasks are performed in this area. Here you can see
  the possibility to develop iFlows for the onPrem Process Integration
  and to process there as well.
 
##  What are the advantages?

    -   Deployment as an integration as a service does not require
        installation or configuration.
    
    -   All actions take place in the browser. This is in line with the
        DevOps approach.
    
    -   Due to the large amount of predefined technical integration
        scenarios, you are quickly productive

##  LESSON SUMMARY
 
  You should now be able to:

    -   Explain the use and the main components of the Cloud Integration
