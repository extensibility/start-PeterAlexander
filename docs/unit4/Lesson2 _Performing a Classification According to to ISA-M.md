# Lesson 2:  Performing a Classification According to to ISA-M
 
##  LESSON OBJECTIVES
 
  After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

    -   Perform a classification according to ISA-M

## Classification According to ISA-M

###  Introduction

  With the ISA-M, customers can systematically and comprehensively determine
  their integration needs.


  The figure, ISA-M Methodology Overview, gives an overview of the ISA-M
  methodology. The following applications are possible:

    -   Enables the systematic selection of integration technologies.
    
    -   Customer-proven set of core integration patterns.
    
    -   Extensible to future use cases and technologies.
    
    -   Focus on key dimensions of the problem space.
    
    -   Open to SAP & non SAP middleware. You can use ISA-M:

    -   as systematic terminology to improve communication between teams.
    
    -   as governance blueprint to provide integration architecture
          guidance.
    
    -   as assessment tool to define and update your integration strategy.
    
    -   as accelerator for pattern-based interface development (reuse).

### Determination of the optimal integration domains

  The figure, Integration Domains, gives an overview of the
  interdependencies between the different integratiton domains.
 
  SAP CPI is particularly suitable for the following scenarios:

    -   Cloud2Cloud.
    
    -   OnPremise2Cloud scenarios.


###  Classification in the four fundamental types of application integration â€“ Integration Styles
 
  SAP CPI is particularly suitable for the process Invocation style.

  The figure, The Four Fundamental Types of Application Integration,
  shows the four fundamental types of application integration.
 
###  The four fundamental types of application integration are:

    1.  Process Invocation - How to chain business processes across business
        applications?
    
    2.  Data Movement - How to synchronize data between business
        applications?
    
    3.  User-Centric Consumption - How to integrate user-centric
        applications with business applications.
    
    4.  Thing Integration - How to integrate real world things with business
        applications.

###  Key Characteristics of Process Invocation
 
  The following table shows the key characteristics of process
  invocation:
 
Key Characteristics of Process Invocation

| Objective               | Chaining of business processes           |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Interaction Type        | System-2-System                          |
| Coupling to Application | Process-Level                            |
| Primary Trigger         | Application Event                        |
| Urgency of Completion   | (Near) Real-Time                         |
| Unit of Data Exchange   | Single Objects                           |
| Specific Requirements   | Transactional Integrity<br>Reliable Messaging<br>Message Orchestration<br>B2B protocol support |


##  LESSON SUMMARY
 
  You should now be able to:

    -   Perform a classification according to ISA-M
