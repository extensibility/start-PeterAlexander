### Facts in a nutshell


   ![](.//media/image2.jpeg)
    

  SAP bases its integration strategy for the Intelligent Enterprise on
  four principles:

        -   out-of-the-box integration,
        
        -   open integration,
        
        -   holistic integration,
        
        -   AI-driven integration

  What exactly does that mean?

### Out-of-the-box integration

  What exactly does that mean? 
 
  SAP software supports end-to-end business processes, including
  out-of-the-box integrations, enabled by a standardized application and
  technology portfolio.
 
  Prepackaged integration content for SAP Cloud Platform Integration
  builds the foundation for integrating applications of the Intelligent
  Enterprise.
 
  ### Open integration
 
  Besides SAP-to-SAP integrations, SAP is open for any third-party
  integration as well as custom extensions. The foundation for open
  integration is based on public APIs. With the SAP Cloud Platform Open
  Connectors service,
 
  SAP provides feature-rich, prebuilt connectors for more than 150
  non-SAP applications.
 
  ### Holistic integration
 
  SAP provides a holistic integration technology portfolio that covers
  all flavors of integration. Based on SAP Cloud Platform Integration
  Suite and SAP HANA Data Management Suite, SAP supports all types of
  integration use cases, ranging from process, data, user, and IoT to
  analytics-centric integration. A methodology helps enterprise
  architects shape their integration strategies, which can include
  integration technologies from SAP and third parties.
 
  ### AI-driven integration
 
  In addition to bringing intelligence into core business processes, SAP
  is using AI techniques to simplify the development of integration
  scenarios. One example is the SAP Cloud Platform Integration Advisor
  service for SAP Cloud Platform Integration. Its crowd- based machine
  learning approach enables users to define, maintain,share, and deploy
  B2B and A2A integration content much faster than building it from
  scratch. Further uses of artificial intelligence in other areas of
  integration, such as for integration monitoring, are planned.
 
## SAP Cloud Platform Integration Suite

 Based on SAP Cloud Platform Integration Suite and SAP HANA Data Management
  Suite, SAP supports all types of integration use cases, ranging from
  process, data, user, and IoT to analytics-centric integration

  SAP Cloud Platform Integration Suite offers:

    -   Out-of-box Integrations - 1100+ prepackaged Content
    
    -   Semantic API's - 1000 APIs from SAP and Partners
    
    -   Open Connectors for hub-based integrations - 160+ Connectors to
        third party apps
    
    -   Machine Learning automates interfaces & mappings - Integration
        Advisor
    
    -   Multicloud deployment offerings - SAP, Hyperscaler, private cloud
    
    -   And tools, tools â€¦
    
###  What's in it ?
  
  ![](.//media/image5.jpeg)

  On the left are the technical SaaS applications from SAP. On the right
  are the professional apps and B2B partners that are available outside
  the SAP world.
 
  In the middle the tools we offer for simplified enterprise integration
  for hybrid, huge and heterogenous environments
 
  In the middle below you will find the hyperscalers such as AWS, Azure
  and other.
 
  With Azure, you can achieve very close interlocking through the
  Emphrase Project. In concrete terms, this means that they have either
  SAP only or only Azure as a contractor.
 
### Components
 
  The following components are part of the Integration Suite:

    -   API Business HUB
    
    -   API Management
    
    -   SAP Graph EX
    
    -   Integration Advisor
    
    -   Cloud Integration
    
    -   Data Intelligence
    
    -   Enterprise Messaging
    
    -   Open Connectors

    -   Serverless Runtimes (belongs also to Extensibility Suite) We will discuss the individual tools in more detail below.

  Typical use case - Build enterprise digital mobile applications with SAP Cloud Platform Integration


  1: The backends are connected via the Cloud Connector, which
  establishes a secure connection between obPrem and Cloud.
 
  2: The connectivity service detects connectivity to the services and
  apps available on SAP Cloud Platform.
 
  3: the data is then processed in the CPI, according to the defined
  flow. 4: Standard API's , such as OData , are used for this purpose.
 
  5: API Management then makes the processed data available as an API.
  6: Various channels can then use this data API.
 
  7: A joint authentication and authorization via the identity provider
  makes the procedure secure.
 
## Typical use case - Monetize your APIs with SAP API Management

![](.//media/image7.jpeg)


  1: The onPrem backend is connected to the Cloud Connector.
 
  2: Other SaaS apps such as SuccessFactors are directly connected.
 
  3: The data is processed via the cloud integration via a configured
  iFlow. 4: API Management provides an API.
 
  5: My apps can now use this API.
 
  6: Data management is handled by an external data center.
 
## LESSON SUMMARY
 
  You should now be able to:

-   Explain the Integration strategy in an overview
