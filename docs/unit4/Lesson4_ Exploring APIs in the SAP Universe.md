# Lesson 4 Exploring APIs in the SAP Universe
##  LESSON OBJECTIVES
 
  After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Explore APIs in the SAP Universe


## APIs in the SAP Universe Overview
 
  The SAP API Business Hub is a web application hosted by SAP to
  discover, explore, and test SAP and partner APIs (application
  programming interfaces) that are required to build extensions or
  process integrations.
 
  APIs in SAP solutions use various protocols, documentation, and access
  mechanisms. Application and integration developers must have a
  consistent overview of the APIs available in the relevant SAP systems
  (deployed on-premise and in the cloud). Testing APIs and building
  prototypes also involves organizing access to relevant systems and
  tenants for developers.
 
  SAP API Business Hub addresses these challenges by offering a central
  catalog of APIs, along with an integrated test environment in the
  cloud for easy testing. SAP API Business Hub covers APIs from SAP
  S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Cloud Platform, SAP Hybris, and more.
 
##  SAP API Business Hub therefore simplifies the development process and reduces effort for:

    -   Application developers when building extensions (for example, when
        building extensions to applications within the same Line of
        Business), mobile applications, or Web applications.
    
    -   Integration developers when developing process integrations to
        third-party systems (Application-to-Application \[A2A\] or
        Business-to-Business \[B2B\]).
### Our Salient Features

  The figure illustrates the entry screen containing OData APIs, Events
  and Integration Content. The following are further explanations about
  the entry screen:
 
###  Simple API discovery and exploration
 
  SAP API Business Hub allows you to find and explore APIs and API
  packages (a group of APIs) from SAP (SAP S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors,
  SAP Hybris, SAP Cloud Platform, and more) and selected partners. You
  can navigate to individual APIs, their resources, and supported
  operations. The integrated comprehensive API documentation in
  accordance with the OpenAPI specification helps you quickly understand
  the behavior of the APIs.
 
###  Collaboration
 
  You can collaborate with other community members by providing comments
  and ratings for APIs you have used and use comments and ratings
  provided by other members to help you select your APIs.
 
###  Sandbox API testing
 
  You can test-drive selected APIs, either by making calls using the
  integrated, cloud-based sandbox test environment or by using your
  application of choice.
 
###  Integration with SAP Web IDE
 
  You can consume APIs on the SAP API Business Hub directly on SAP Web
  IDE to develop SAP Fiori extension apps.
 
###  Simple Integration with API Management
 
  As discussed in other lessons, the SAP Business Hub is deeply
  integrated with API Management.
 
###  Build and Provided along openAPI Specification
 
  As discussed in other lessons, the SAP Business Hub is build and
  provided along openAPI specifications.
 
##  Benefits of Using the SAP API Business Hub are:
 
     - Simplification
 
  SAP API Business Hub is a one-stop catalog to find, learn about, and
  consume an ever- increasing number of SAP and selected partner APIs
  from different areas. As the repository is hosted and operated by SAP,
  it is always up to date and easy to access.
 
###  Streamlined development
 
  SAP API Business Hub enables a streamlined development process by
  eliminating overhead and technical prerequisites by providing Web
  tooling and cloud-based services.
 
###  Reduced total cost of extension and development
 
  Improves productivity by offering a comprehensive and easy learning
  and testing environment for developers. Easy consumption of APIs to
  develop SAP Fiori extension apps is enabled via integration with SAP
  Web IDE.
 
##  The Business Hub, a small tour
 
  As an example of the API Business Partner, we want to show the
  essential features. We are looking for business partners and find the
  appropriate interface. As an example of the API Business Partner, we

  Explanations about the bullets:

1.  Here we find the different entities of the OData interface. We are
    on the *A\_AddressEmailAddress* entity.

1.  This entity has the following URLs and http verbs to access the
    data.

2.  Here you can test the interface against a sandbox.

 
  ![Entry Screen for Testing](.//media/image22.jpeg)
  
  
4. Here we find code snippets um to call this interface in different
      languages.


5.  This is the API key to call this interface from the outside.

6.  Here we can download a client sdk in Java that was created from the
      API Doc.

7.  Here we find the API documentation according to openAPI.

##  Interface Call in customer own systems
 
 
  ![Code Snippets5](.//media/image23.jpeg)
 
  We can configure the interface, if available on your system, against your
  own system. To do this, we use the Link *Configure Environments*:
 
  Now we can try each verb and URL on this client to retrieve the data
  from our own system:

  The figure shows the screen, to enter the required data.
 
## LESSON SUMMARY
 
  You should now be able to:
