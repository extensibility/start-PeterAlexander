-   Explain the ideas and innovations of an experience management of an
    industry cloud

## Ideas and Innovations of the Experience Management of an Industry Cloud

 In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

-   X-and o data

-   Industry - Means Core Business

-   New API Framework of the Intelligent Enterprise – SAP Graph and its
    new Business Model

-   Business Process Model

-   Business and Technology Services

-   Vertical Edge

-   The Four Main Use Cases of SAP

## X-and O data

### Facts about x-and o data

    -   To get a full view of the customers, to improve your business, you need not only the (o) opaque data but also the (x) behavioral data of these customers.

![](.//media/image7.jpeg)

This is summarized again in the following picture.


 On the left side you can see the experience data that describes the
 behavior of the business partner, employee, customer or product.

 On the right side you can see the operational data, such as functional
 data of the different modules, as well as the technical data. In
 between is the Business Technology Platform which combines both data
 to a complete view of the customer.

### In short:

#### \(o\) Operational data are:

    -   All business data

    -   All technical data

#### \(x\) Experience data are:

 All data that directly affects the customer, emotions, opinions,
 perceptions and many more.

#### The NEW one:

 is now to connect this information. This requires a Technology
 Platform that allows this, in a simple and wise able way.

 The technology platform is the SAP Cloud Platform ( BTP):

 It is a portfolio of integrated solutions that accelerate
 transformation of data into business value. It includes:

    -   database and data management,
    
    -   application development,
    
    -   Integration,
    
    -   intelligent technologies from on-premise to the cloud.

 We will deal with the BTP in detail later.

## Industry - Means Core Business 
---
### Industry cloud is our strategy:

    -   To extend the intelligent suite with innovative industry cloud
         solutions.
    
    -   Built by SAP and our partners in the cloud.
    
    -   Based on SAP Cloud Platform.
    
    -   Running on the cloud infrastructure of SAP and our hyperscaler
         partners.

 The intelligent suite offers best practices and support for end to end
 processes for all industries as the foundation for:

    -   efficient operations of finance,
    
    -   material management,
    
    -   supply chains,
    
    -   or asset management.

 The following picture illustrates the situation

![](.//media/image8.jpeg)

In the area of applications, you can see the innovative extensions to the right of the Intelligent Suite. At the moment the focus is on the 4 preliminary processes:

    -   Design-to-Operate
    
    -   Total Workforce Management
    
    -   Lead-to-Cash
    
    -   Source-to-Pay

 The Intelligent Suite and also the innovative extensions run on the
 technology layer represented by the BTP.

 The open business and technology platform supports in particular in
 the following areas:

    -   Process Modell
    
    -   Data Modell
    
    -   Business Services
    
    -   APIs

 Let us take a closer look at the individual areas.

## New API Framework of the Intelligent Enterprise – SAP Graph and its new Business Model
--- 

 In addition to the well-known API's such as REST, OData and SOAP,
 there is a new innovative API framework based on oData.

![](.//media/image9.jpeg)

#### More Details:

 SAP Graph is an API for accessing SAP-managed data. It exposes the SAP
 ODM, a unified graph-like domain model of business objects (domain
 entities, like Products, Sales Orders and Customers) and relationships
 (links) to users of client applications, hence its name.

 Application developers use SAP Graph as a RESTful service to navigate
 and access the data, regardless of where (in which SAP business or
 industry-specific system) this data resides, on premise or in the
 cloud.

 SAP Graph uses open standards like OData v.4 as a single access
 protocol and OAuth for unified authentication. By unifying the data
 access to a single interface, the entry barrier for extending the
 Intelligent Enterprise gets lowered significantly. Overall, SAP Graph
 leads to higher productivity and a better development experience.

 If the ODM provides all necessary data objects for your industry cloud
 solution, you must use SAP Graph. SAP Graph is designed for developers
 of extension applications.

 The figure shows a schematic overview of SAP Graph.

 SAP Graph combines the data from different business domains. Here e.g.
 products, quotas and orders and makes them available as OData. It is
 more than just views of technical data as it is based on a new
 business domain model.

 Business Modell of SAP Graph

 The model no longer consists of just one professional domain. Combined
 models are created along defined processes. This graph approach is
 used , to connect very large sets of distributed data, to create a
 dynamic schema and to determine the interconnections between the
 online actions for the Intelligent Enterprise processes.

#### SAP focuses on the following processes:

    -   Design-to-Operate
    
    -   Total Workforce Management
    
    -   Lead-to-Cash
    
    -   Source-to-Pay
    
    -   And several cross entities

 #### Examples of cross entities are :

    -   Bank Identifiers
    
    -   Budget Periods
    
    -   Business Partners
    
    -   Checks
    
    -   Company Codes
    
    -   Cost Centers
    
    -   Country Codes
    
    -   Currency Codes
    
    -   And more- see https://beta.graph.sap


## The Business Process Model
---
### Business Process Model

 The data model, domain model, and APIs are important to give industry
 cloud solutions access to the end-to-end process support in the
 intelligent suite. Understanding the effects of invoking an API that
 creates, deletes, or changes an object in the intelligent suite
 requires a business process model that describes the side effects of
 those operations.

 SAP provides the business architecture framework serving as the
 foundation that helps developers design, build, test, and validate
 industry cloud solutions.

 Each industry cloud solution also comes with content from SAP Model
 Company services and content that describes how to configure the
 intelligent suite to enable plugging in the solution.

### Business and Technology Services

 Industry cloud solutions have ready access to a broad range of
 business and technology services that make life easy for developers.

 These range from simple business services such as currency or unit
 conversion to Leading edge artificial intelligence and machine
 learning libraries. With user experience libraries, solution designers
 can give users a seamless experience as they run end-to-end processes
 that span multiple industry cloud solutions, the intelligent suite,
 and business networks.

 Subscription management, invoicing, usage monitoring, and application
 support are also managed through integrated central services.

## Vertical Edge
---

![](.//media/image13.jpeg)

Every path needs goals and waypoints. On the way to the Intelligent Enterprise, SAP describes goals and waypoints for several industries.The goals are known as vertical edges.

The individual industrial sectors are divided into columns. The journey begins from below. Taking Human Resources as an example, this looks like this.

## Further Facts:
---
#### Best Practices - Now

 Onboarding employees quickly and seamlessly.

#### Next Practices - Next Step

 Identifying and securing talent for prosumer engagement.

#### Vertical Edge - Goal

 Identifying, forecasting, and addressing skill gaps Empowering
 employees to make decisions in real time.

## The Four Main Use Cases of SAP
---
 In order to make the many innovations, ideas and innovations available
 to the customer, SAP applies this to 4 selected process.

![](.//media/image14.jpeg)

 On the picture you can see the four main customer processes that are
 currently in the focus. The processes are divided into uses cases.

 The processes are :

    -   Design-to-Operate
    
    -   Total Workforce Management
    
    -   Lead-to-Cash
    
    -   Source-to-Pay

## Get Deeper

### Design-to-Operate (D2O)

 Is the Digital Supply Chain & Manufacturing contribution to the
 Intelligent Enterprise Suite and delivers a seamlessly integrated
 Supply Chain which is enriched by intelligent technologies across the
 entire Digital Supply Chain portfolio:

    -   including Design,
    
    -   Plan,
    
    -   Manufacture,
    
    -   Deliver,
    
    
    -   and Operate solutions,

 primarily from a Manufacturer and Operator perspective, with a
 principle focus on manufacturing industries in the initial delivery.

### Total Workforce Management

 Manages all aspects of the total workforces (employees and external
 workers) in line with company's business objectives and a clear line
 of sight into the financial impact. It enables the end-to-end business
 process of planning, sourcing, and managing the total workforce, and
 facilitates a holistic talent strategy to achieve agility and
 game-changing business outcomes.

 The Total Workforce Management includes all the activities needed to
 maintain a productive workforce, such as:

    -   the Core HR management,
    
    -   performance and training
    
    -   management,
    
    -   but also recruiting,
    
    -   forecasting,
    
    -   etc.

### Lead to Cash

 Typically one of the most important business process for many
 companies, because it is the process ultimately responsible for
 driving revenue for an organization. From a high level perspective,
 the Lead-to-Cash process connects a customer's interest to buy (SAP
 C/4 HANA) to a company's realization of revenue (in the back-end SAP
 S/4HANA system), bringing the front office together with back office.

### Source-to-Pay

 While companies often focus on revenue, sourcing and procurement
 savings can increase profits about five times more. In the Intelligent
 Enterprise process definition, both the steps - Sourcing and
 Procurement are comprised - with Sourcing being the strategic process
 of ensuring, e.g that the right suppliers get chosen. And Procurement
 being the operational process that takes care of the actual
 procurement of direct material, indirect materials, or services
