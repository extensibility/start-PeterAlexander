 The Business Technology Platform focuses on Application Development and Integration If we look at the Application Development and Integration section more closely, we can identify two basic use cases. The integration an expansion of heterogeneous landscapes, services and processes.

 ### The Cloud Platform consists of two main areas:

    -   The Integration Suite
    
    -   The Extension Suite

 On the left-hand side, you see all the cloud systems that are out
 there in the world, may it be an SAP system or a non SAP system.

 And on the right-hand side, you see systems on premise. So here SAP
 systems with SAP S/ 4HANA or an S/4 Enterprise Suite, for instance,
 but it could also be non-SAP systems. 
 
### Integration Suite

    -   Makes sure that you have the right data at the right time in the right system whenever you need that.

### Extension Suite

 The Extension Suite comes:

    -   with best run methodologies
    
    -   and guidance
    
    -   and guidelines
    
    -   for the customers on how to implement a good user experience, a good
        process integration, and more.

 So we don't just put the tools in place, but we also provide the
 guidance for the customers to leverage those tools and services and to
 achieve their goals much faster. Also, on the right- hand side, you
 see the ready-to-use business content.

 So the SAP Cloud Platform is not just a set of tools, it also provides
 ready-to-use business content that helps you to integrate and extend
 in the best possible way and in the fastest way.

 With the integration and extension suite, we will be working
 intensively afterwards. We'll take a closer look at the Business
 Technology Platform - Cloud Platform in a separate chapter
