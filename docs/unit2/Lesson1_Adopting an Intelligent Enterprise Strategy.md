 processes. The network builds on current procurement, travel, and
 contingent workforce solutions to help intelligent enterprises work
 together to create flexible value chains.

### Applications

 The Applications includes the Experience Management, the Intelligent
 Suite and the Industrie Cloud. Experience Management understanding
 what people want, and how they feel is critical to making the right
 decisions. Experience management solutions give insight on the
 sentiments and feelings of customers, employees, and other business
 stakeholders.

#### Intelligent Suite:

 SAP offers an integrated suite of applications - the intelligent
 suite- that support your end-to-end business processes. These would be
 S/4HANA with different deployment options, SAP 3 and the various SaaS
 solutions such as SuccessFactoirs, Concur, Fieldglass and many more.
 SAP's industry cloud will enable you to discover and deploy vertical

 will help customers understand and manage their impact on people and
 the environment.

 The BTP provides data management and analytics, supports application
 development and integration, and allows you to use intelligent
 technologies - such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
 the Internet of Things - to drive innovation.
