## The Human Challenge of Cloud Native

 In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

-   What is corporate culture?

-   The three main types of corporate culture.

## What is corporate culture?
---
    -   In a business context, the *do* is how the people within your
        organization interact, communicate, and work with each other.
    
    -   In short:
    
     - Culture is the way your enterprise goes about creating and delivering your service or product.

 If you have the perfect set of cloud platform, tools, and techniques
 yet go about using them in the wrong way - if you apply the right
 tools in an improper way because that is how your culture has always
 dictated you use any and every kind of tool - it's simply not going to
 work.

 At best, you'll be functional but far from capturing the value that
 the system you've just built can deliver. At worst, your system simply
 won't work at all.

## The three main types of corporate culture
---
 The three major types of culture within enterprises track closely with
 the type of product/service delivery process the organization follows:

    -   Waterfall,
    
    -   Agile,
    
    -   Cloud native.

### Waterfall

 Waterfall organizations are all about long-term planning. They deliver
 a single large, solidly built, and thoroughly tested deployment every
 six months to one year (perhaps even longer). They are risk-averse,
 with a long decision-making chain and rigid hierarchy.

 Waterfall organizations tend to have specialist teams handling very
 specific skills - security, testing, database administration, and so
 on.

### Agile

 Agile development breaks applications into their functional
 components, each of which is worked on start to finish by a single
 team. Instead of handoffs between specialist teams, Agile has
 cross-functional teams whose members hold all the skills necessary to
 design, build, and test the service they are responsible for
 developing. The result: there are wide responsibilities in a team, but
 a very narrow responsibility for the team. Scrum is one functional
 implementation of Agile process. Roles in this system include the
 teams themselves; Scrum Masters, who facilitate between the different
 process-owner teams; and Product Owners, who have full ownership of
 the delivered functionality and the deadlines.

 Agile-ish organizations are a hybrid breed. Typically they are
 Waterfall organizations that have made some moves toward Agile.

### Cloud native

 Cloud native organizations are built to take optimum advantage of
 functioning in cloud technologies; the cloud of course will continue
 to evolve and will look quite different in the future, but we also
 build to anticipate this. Applications are built and deployed in a
 rapid cadence by small, dedicated feature teams made up of developers
 who also know how to build in networking, security, and all other
 necessities so all parts of the distributed system become part of the
 application. Meanwhile a platform team sits off to one side, designing
 and assembling the platform the developments will deploy to. This
 highly automated platform uses an orchestrator like Kubernetes to
 manage the complexity.

 This organization could also work in an Infrastructure-as-a-Service or
 a traditional virtualized VMware environment. However, taking maximum
 advantage of cloud technology means moving to approaches like minimum
 viable product (MVP) development, multivariate testing, abandoning
 specialist teams for DevOps, and embracing not just rapid iteration
 but rapid delivery/deployment (i.e., continuous integration and
 continuous delivery, even continuous deployment). Some of these are
 part of Agile, at least when fully practiced, but they are all
 necessary for cloud native.

 Cloud native architecture centers on microservices architecture (i.e.,
 de-composing applications into small, loosely coupled services that
 operate completely independently from one another). Architecture then
 influences process: each of these services maps to smaller,
 independent development teams that release iterative software updates
 as soon as they are ready. Rapid release of software creates a tighter
 feedback loop, allowing enterprises to easily adapt and respond to
 customer demands and desires.

### Conclusion

 If a company wants to operate cloud native it must necessarily
 implement the cloud native culture in the company. Otherwise you will
 fail.
