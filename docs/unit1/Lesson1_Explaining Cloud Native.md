# Lesson 1: Explaining Cloud Native
##  LESSON OBJECTIVES

### In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

    -   Cloud Native Is Not Cloud Computing <
    
    -   First Definition for Cloud Native
    
    -   Second Definition for Cloud Native
    
    -   Benefits for you as a customer


## Cloud Native Is Not Cloud Computing
---
Though the terms are often confused, cloud computing and cloud native
are two entirely separate entities:

    - Cloud Computing
            
    - Cloud native

### Cloud computing:

-   Technical Infrastructure delivered from hyperscaler like Google,
    Azure, Amazon and more.

-   Is the on-demand deliveryof infrastructure (hardware/servers),
    storage, databases, and all kinds of application services via the
    internet. Frequently these are delivered by a Hyperscaler like
    Google, Azure and more.

### Cloud native

-   Service based architecture to solve business requirements. For this
    purpose, procedures such as microservices, DevOps, Serverless and
    many other concepts are applied.

-   Is an architecture for assembling all of the above cloud-based
    components in a way that is optimized for the cloud environment.

-   It's not about the servers, but the services. So cloud native is
    also an organizational destination

## First Definition for Cloud Native
---
 Below is a first definition according to CNCF:
### Cloud native computing uses

    -   an open source software stack to deploy applications as
        microservices,
    
    -   packaging each part into its own container,
    
    -   and dynamically orchestrating those containers
    
    -   to optimize resource utilization.
    
        Essentially, cloud native is the name of an approach to designing,
        building, and running computer applications
    
    -   The architecture rests upon Infrastructure-as-a-Service, combined
        with new operational tools and services like continuous integration,
        container engines, and orchestrators.
    
    -   The objective, usually, is to improve speed. Companies of all sizes
        now see strategic advantage in being able to move quickly and get to
        market fast â€” putting a new idea into production within days or even
        hours, instead of months.

## Second Definition for Cloud Native:
---
    -  Cloud native is about  how we create and deliver, not where.


### The fundamentals of cloud native are most often described with 5 principles :

    -   Containerization
    
    -   Dynamic Management
    
    -   Microservices
    
    -   Automation
    
    -   Orchestration

#### Cultural principles:

    -   Delegation
    
    -   Dynamic strategy

Let's go more into details and let's briefly consider the individual terms:

#### Containerization

Encapsulating applications together with their dependencies/operating
environment, all in a single package. This makes them easy to test,
move, and deploy.

#### Dynamic management

 Using cloud-based servers that can be flexibly provisioned on demand;
if on a public cloud, which is typical, companies pay only for
resources when they are used.

#### Microservices


Designing applications as a collection of small, decoupled component
services. Each microservice can be deployed, upgraded, scaled, and
restarted independent of other services in the application, and with
no impact on the end user.

#### Automation

 Replacing manual tasks, like maintenance and updating, with scripts or
code so they happen seamlessly and reliably.

#### Orchestration

Tying it all together by automating the deployment, scaling, and
management of containerized applications.

In addition to the more technical definitions, there are two very
important cultural definitions.

### The two cultural principles are:

#### Delegation

Offering individuals the tools, training, and discretion they need to
safely make changes, then deploying and monitoring them as
 autonomously as possible (i.e., without needing to hand off to other
 teams or seek permission through a slow management approval process).

#### Dynamic strategy

 Communicating strategy to teams, but allowing them to modify that
 strategy in response to their results. That is the ultimate purpose of
 the fast, experimental deployment that cloud native provides: there's
 no point running experiments if you don't make use of what you learn.

## Benefits for you as a customer
---
### The benefits are:

    -   Companies can use many it finished parts.
    
    -   This use can be done in microtransactions.
    
    -   Companies can scale globally if successful.
    
    -   If the application is not used, for example in the event of failure,
        companies do not have to pay for IT usage.

## LESSON SUMMARY

 You should now be able to:

    -   Explain the difference between cloud native and cloud computing
