# Lesson 3:  Explaining Definitions

## LESSON OBJECTIVES
---
 After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

    - Explain, how the IT stack is structured and how the terms Dedicated, Virtualized, IaaS, Container PaaS, Serverless, and SaaS are related to it

## Definitions
---
 In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

    - It’s All About Services
    
    - The IT Stack
    
    - Deployment Models

## It’s All About Services
---
 The heart of cloud native is cloud-based services. This is the
 platform upon which we

    - Build
    
    - Launch
    
    - Operate
    
    - Distribute
    
    - Containerize
    
    - Automated
    
    - A modular application empire.….

 In the following we will look at the service models in relation to the
 IT stack.

 The figure illustrates the IT stack.

### The levels of the stack are

     - The IT stack is divided into eight levels below the software application.

#### Network

    - This layer of the stack allows the software to exchange information and data with other computers.

#### Storage

     - The next level is the Storage layer, in which the application data and the data of the operating system are stored.

#### Server

     -  Physical server with CPU's and memory.

#### Virtualization

    - Is the decoupling between physical servers and virtual machines.

#### Operating System

     - Elementary computational and administrative functions.

#### Databases

 Efficient, consistent and durable storage of large amounts of data.

#### Runtimes & Libraies

     - Stand-as-stand deployment of programming interfaces and basic
 functions. Utilities (libraries) provide ready-made features.

#### Security & Integration

    - Services and Tools to protect the application from unauthorized
 access.

### Dedicated

 Includes the complete IT stack as it was previously used in the onPrem
 environment. The customer is responsible for all levels. Before even
 one application runs, high initial expenses have to be incurred. This
 costs a lot of money and time.

    -  Here the customer is only responsible for the storage and network.

 Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): This is the obvious one, and it
 includes networking, storage, server and virtualization. Hiring
 infrastructure rather than owning it allows you to maximize the
 creativity of each team instead of limiting it to the capabilities of
 a central architecture team.

 IaaS provider (Hyperscaler) are Google Cloud Platform , Azure, AWS and
 many more.

 Container-as-a-Service: This lets you hand over container engines,
 orchestration, and all underlying (IaaS) compute resources for
 delivery to users as a service from your cloud provider.

 Platform-as-a-Service: This can be used to manage and maintain all
 that virtualized infrastructure, greatly reducing the load on your Ops
 (or Platform) team.

 SAP Cloud Platform is a PaaS.

 Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the
 cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically manages the allocation
 of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of
 resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased
 units of capacity.

 Software-as-a-Service: This allows you to pick and choose component
 applications, everything from traditional business software (think MS
 Office 365 or Google Mail) to virtual infrastructure management tools,
 all delivered via - and operated over - the web. The provider ensures
 security, availability, and performance.

## Deployment Models
---
 Cloud services differ in different types of deployment. Depending on
 who offers the services and to which target group they are targeted,
 it is referred to as:

    -   Public Clouds
    
    -   Private Clouds
    
    -   Hybrid Clouds
    
    -   Community Cloud

### Public Cloud

 The public cloud or public cloud is an offer of a freely accessible
 provider, which makes its services openly accessible to everyone via
 the Internet. Webmailer services or the well-known Google Docs are
 examples of public cloud offerings as well as the paid services of a
 Microsoft Office 365 or an SAP Business by Design.

### Private Cloud

 Private cloud services are on the other hand. For privacy and IT
 security reasons, organizations often prefer to continue to run their
 IT services themselves and make them accessible only to their own
 employees. If these are offered in such a way that the end user in the
 enterprise can take advantage of cloud-typical added value, such as a
 scalable IT infrastructure or installation- and maintenance-free IT
 applications that can be used via the web browser, then is called a
 private cloud. Often, however, these additional values are not or only
 partially achieved in so-called IT infrastructures.

### Hybrid Clouds

 Hybrid clouds are called hybrid forms of these two approaches. For
 example, certain services at public providers run over the Internet,
 while data-critical applications and data are operated and processed
 in the enterprise. The challenge here lies in the separation of
 business processes into data protection-critical and non-critical
 workflows. The prerequisite is a clean and consistent classification
 of the data available and processed in the company.

### Community Clouds

 The so-called community clouds are a rather rare special case. This is
 called cloud infrastructures that are used and deployed by multiple
 organizations, such as in the context of a project, to share access to
 specific services. However, these are not publicly available, but are
 limited to a defined user group.

 On the left side are the 4 most important influencing factors. In
 addition, the comparison of the deployment models Private - and Public
 Cloud.

 You can immediately see that public cloud is the method of choice for
 fast innovative applications.

## LESSON SUMMARY
---
 You should now be able to:

    -   Explain, how the IT stack is structured and how the terms Dedicated,
    Virtualized, IaaS, Container PaaS, Serverless, and SaaS are related
    to it
