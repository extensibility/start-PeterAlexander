 an overview of the services and tools in the area of security.

 The figure illustrates the SAP product context. In detail:

### Authentication & Single Sign-on

-   SAP CP Identity Authentication

-   SAP Single Sign-On Identity Management

-   SAP CP Identity Provisioning service

-   SAP Identity Management Governance, Risk & Compliance

-   SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance

-   SAP Access Control

 We focus on the services SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication
 and SAP Cloud Platform Identity Provisioning that help us to work
 safely.

### Information about the SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication:

-   Simplify and secure cloud-based access to business processes,
    applications, and data with state-of-the-art authentication
    mechanisms, single sign-on, on-premise integration, and convenient
    self-service options

-   These are:

    -   Two-factor authentication

    -   Customer and partner onboarding

    -   Secure integration

### SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance

 Streamline identity and access management (IAM) in complex on-premise
 and cloud environments with SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance
 software. You can improve IAM practices with an intuitive,
 dashboard-driven interface and a simple single sign-on (SSO)
 experience in the cloud.

### Information about SAP Cloud Platform Identity Provisioning:

-   Automate identity lifecycle processes to provision identities and
     their authorizations to cloud and on-premise applications.

-   Define user access based on identity attributes such as current
     group or role assignment and location.

## LESSON SUMMARY

 You should now be able to:

-   Figure out, how the domain model works and name the main services

 Explaining Platform Security
============================

## LESSON OBJECTIVES

 After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Differentiate between authentication and authorization and how both
    are used on the SAP Cloud Platform

## Platform Security

 In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

-   SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication - IDP.

-   SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication - Service.

-   User and Role Management on SAP Cloud Platform.

-   SAP Cloud Identity Provisioning Service.

-   Bringing all together.

 <img src=".//media/image8.jpeg" style="width:2.1775in;height:1.82406in" /SAP
 Cloud Platform Identity Authentication - IDP

 SAP CP uses out of the box, the Identity Providers (IDP) for user
 authentication. He has the role of a user store:

1.  External Authentication providers (SAML).

2.  Authenticated identity is used inside SAP Cloud Platform.

 Freedom of choice of IDP

 SAML2 standard provides choice of authentication provider.

 <img src=".//media/image9.jpeg" style="width:1.82812in;height:1.60875in" /SAP\_CP\_Identity\_Authentication
 can use on-premise IDP's (AD, LDAP, SAP) for user authentication:

-   Re-use existing IDP, easy to implement.

-   Maintain central user repository (no user sync needed). SAML2
     capable IDP's can be integrated, for example:

-   MS ADFS

-   MS AZURE

-   …

 Change the IDP on Subaccount Level

![](.//media/image10.jpeg)

 You can change the SAML 2.0 IDP Provider on Subaccount level.

 SAML 2.0 Response after successful Login to IDP

![](.//media/image11.jpeg)

 Here is the SAML 2.0 Response from IDP to SAP Cloud Platform after
 successfull login.

## SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication - Service

 By default, SAP always uses the IDP as the identity provider. However,
 it only offers basic functions like User Authentication as a user
 store.

 To take advantage of all possibilities, the Identity Authentication
 Service can be licensed. It offers almost all conceivable options
 based on SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect Standard.

 <img src=".//media/image12.jpeg" style="width:1.82in;height:2.20594in" /Additionally,
 you still need an Identity Provider, for example the IDP from SAP or
 from third- party companies.

 The example above uses two IDPs. The Features are:

-   Basic authentication

-   Re-use of Windows Domain Logon

-   Two-factor authentication



-   Delegated logon

## Information about User and Role Management on SAP Cloud Platform

 Table 9: User and Role Management on SAP Cloud Platform

 No user identities are held on the SAP Cloud Platform. However,
 domain-dependent system and service roll and groups are used.

 These roles and groups are either created directly on the SAP Cloud
 Platform, for example, or existing ones are imported and mapped to the
 Platform Roles or Groups. This is done with the SAP Cloud Identity
 Provisioning Service.

 You can identify the following user types. A developer can also be a
 business.

 <img src=".//media/image13.jpeg" style="width:3.99344in;height:1.2675in" /Roles
 and Groups on the SAP Cloud Platform - Platform Users

 On global level the Administrator role is assigned.

 <img src=".//media/image14.jpeg" style="width:4.03in;height:1.68594in" /Roles
 and Groups on the SAP Cloud Platform - Platform Users

 On subaccont level, the Organisation Roles are assigned.

## Roles and Groups on the SAP Cloud Platform - Platform Users

![](.//media/image15.jpeg)

 On subaccont level also the Security Administrators are assigned.

## Roles and Groups on the SAP Cloud Platform - Platform Users

![](.//media/image16.jpeg)

 On space level the Spaces Roles are assigned.

## Appication Users - Service Roles

![](.//media/image17.jpeg)

 However, the service roles still have to be assigned to the
 corresponding user. You can see how this can be done in the case of
 your own service in the next Lesson with a Business User.

 <img src=".//media/image18.jpeg" style="width:4.5175in;height:1.89312in" /SAP
 Cloud Identity Provisioning Service

 In order to use existing roles and groups, for example in the SAP
 Cloud Platform, these can be mapped manually via the SAP Cloud
 Platform Identity Provisioning Service.

 <img src=".//media/image19.jpeg" style="width:4.00562in;height:2.3725in" /Bringing

 Explaining Application Security
===============================

## LESSON OBJECTIVES

 After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Appreciate the secure implementation of a microapp

## Application Security

 In particular, we'll look at the following topics in this lesson:

-   How Application Security works

-   The Approuter

-   Json Web Token (JWT)

-   Extended Services for User Account and Authentication (XSUAA)

-   Assigning Users to Application Roles

## How Application Security works

 We limit ourselves to what we're doing in Cloud Foundry. The following
 example describes a microservices in Java.

![](.//media/image26.jpeg)

 The figure above illustrates a high-level authentication setup.
 Further details:

## The App Router (1) 
Its tasks are:

-   The App Router is the central entry point for our application it
    dispatches requests to our back end microservices, thus acting as a
    reverse proxy. The back end microservices should not be directly
    accessible by the client.

-   The App Router can serve static content such as web pages, SAPUI5,
    or another client-side code.

-   The App Router manages the authentication flows for our entire
    application

 For authentication (who the user is) and authorization (what the user
 is allowed to do), the App Router takes all incoming, unauthenticated
 request and initiates an OAuth2 flow (authorization code grant) with
 the Extended Services for User Account and Authentication (XSUAA)
 service of the SAP Cloud Platform in the Cloud Foundry environment .

### Install via Service Marketplace

 The App Router is a *Node.js* component, distributed via the
 publically available SAP NPM registry.

 <img src=".//media/image27.jpeg" style="width:1.80375in;height:1.65344in" /The
 Application Router's Design-Time Descriptor: xs-app.json

 The xs-app.json file can be used to configure many more aspects at
 design-time of the AppRouter like authentication types, cache control,
 compression threshold for outgoing traffic (by default, 1 KB),
 client-initiated logout, custom settings for CSRF protection, and much
 more.

 <img src=".//media/image28.jpeg" style="width:2.09219in;height:1.82in" /The
 AppRouter's Runtime Configuration within the manifest.yaml

 Besides destinations and tenant host patterns, the AppRouter
 understands many different parameters that can be changed during
 runtime, without redeploying the entire AppRouter,

 which is consistent with the twelve-factor application principles.
 Recognized parameters include cross-origin policies, session timeouts,
 compression thresholds, JWT refresh times, etc.

 <img src=".//media/image29.jpeg" style="width:2.93312in;height:1.70625in" /The
 Application Security Descriptor: xs-security.json

 The xs-security.json descriptor is an important design-time artifact
 to provide authorization scopes, role templates, and other attributes
 of the application itself as well as foreign applications. This file
 will be imported while the XSUAA Service will be create.

## Json Web Token (JWT)

 JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a
 compact and self- contained way for securely transmitting information
 between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and
 trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a
 secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using
 RSA or ECDSA.

 Although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between
 parties, we will focus

 <img src=".//media/image30.jpeg" style="width:4.225in;height:2.7625in" /on
 signed tokens. Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims
 contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from
 other parties. When tokens are signed using public/ private key pairs,
 the signature also certifies that only the party holding the private
 key is the one that signed it.

 The figure shows an example of a JWT.

### When should you use JSON Web Tokens?

 Here are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:

### Authorization

 This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is
 logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the
 user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with
 that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays,
 because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across
 different domains.

### Information Exchange

 JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information
 between parties. Because JWTs can be signed-for example, using
 public/private key pairs-you can be sure the senders are who they say
 they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the
 header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't
 been tampered with.

## User Assignment to Application Roles

![](.//media/image31.jpeg)

 In the xs-security.json we define Role Templates, Roles and Scopes. We
 need to assign these to users who want to use our app in the
 subaccount under *Trust*.

 To do this, we need to create a role collection in the subaccount and
 assign the role-template from the xs-security.json.

 Procedure to assign users:

-   Create the *Role Collection* in the Subaccount.

-   Assign the role template from the xs-security.json to the *Role
    Collection*.

-   Under *Trust Configuration* select the current SAP ID service and
    enter the corresponding user as email address.

-   Add the Role Collection to the user.

## Protecting the back end application

![](.//media/image32.jpeg)

 Now that we've introduced scopes and role templates to the XSUAA
 service instance, we'll need to protect our application accordingly.
 Basically, two places exist where you can check authorizations: inside
 the AppRouter and in the back end microservices.

 Use Scopes to protect your app:

-   Within the xs-app.json you define the protected routes.

-   In the web.xml of your back end service you set the security
    requirements for Authentication and Authorisation.

## Protect the Implementation

 At the method level in *my implementation* you assign the scope.
